Intention is to ease the design process by providing helpful rules to create a succesful API that your customers will love.\r\nPlease follow the guidelines but don't follow blindly! You can break the rules with justification. Please inform the CTO Office (mailto:_CTOLeads@haufe-lexware.com) in this cases.\r\n\r\nThe style guide focuses on REST APIs cause this is the preferred way to expose APIs to our services.\r\n\r\nFor the creation of the style guide I took a lot of input from other authors and even copied whole passages.\r\n\r\nI want to gratefully thank these authors and hope that I marked the relevant passages.\r\nMy resources are listed under [Further Resources](further-resources.md).
