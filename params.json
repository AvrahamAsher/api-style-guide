Intention is to ease the design process by providing helpful rules to create a succesful API that your customers will love.  \r\nThe style guide focuses on **REST APIs** cause this is the preferred way to expose APIs to our services.\r\n\r\n###How to use the guide\r\nThe API style guide MUST be used when you create an API, refactor or extend an API.\r\nExisting APIs might be subject to adapt if there is business value in it.\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the API designer to apply the API style guide to a specific API and project!\r\n\t\r\n>\tPlease follow the guidelines, but don't follow blindly!  \r\n>\tYou can break the rules with justification.\r\n\r\nThe style guide is work in progress. We’d love your feedback – whether you agree, disagree, or have some additional practices and tips to add.\r\n\r\n>\tWe encourage you to improve the style guide with modifications and extensions.\r\n>\tInform the CTO Office (mailto:_CTOLeads@haufe-lexware.com) in this cases.\r\n>\r\n>\tPlease contribute! \r\n\r\n### API Design Review Process\r\nWe are still at the beginning of our journey to an API driven company.   \r\nThere will be pros and cons how to handle and apply the style guide to real projects.\r\nThere are many things to learn and to share with another.\r\n\r\nTo support the mutual experience exchange we decided to establish an **API Design Review Process**.\r\nEach new or refactored API MUST run through this process.\r\nHave a look at [API Design Review Process](api-design-review-process.md) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Content\r\n\r\n####Most important chapters\r\nPlease start with the chapters [API design best practices](api-design-best-practices.md)\r\nand [REST principles](rest-principles.md).\r\nThese chapters describe the intention and mindset how we want to design an API.\r\nEach section contains links to the chapters with more details.\r\n\r\nThe covered chapters are:\r\n\r\n- [API design best practices](api-design-best-practices.md)\r\n- [REST principles](rest-principles.md)\r\n- [URI Components](uri-components.md)\r\n- [HTTP Verbs](http-verbs.md)\r\n- [Hypermedia and REST](hypermedia-and-rest.md) \r\n- [Resources](resources.md)\r\n- [Relationships and Sub-Resources](relationships-and-sub-resources.md)\r\n- [Collection Resources](collection-resources.md)\r\n\t- [Resource naming](collection-resources.md#resource-naming) \r\n\t- [Get List of resources](collection-resources.md#get-list-of-resources)\r\n\t- [Read Single Resource](collection-resources.md#read-single-resources)\r\n\t- [Update Single Ressource](collection-resources.md#update-single-ressource)\r\n\t- [Update Partial Single Resource](collection-resources.md#update-partial-single-resource)\r\n\t- [Delete Single Resource](collection-resources.md#delete-single-resource)\r\n\t- [Create New Resource](collection-resources.md#create-new-resource)\r\n\t- [Create New Resource - Consumer Supplied Identifier](collection-resources.md#create-new-resource---consumer-supplied-identifier) \r\n- [Filtering, sorting, field selection and paging](filtering-sorting-field-selection-and-paging.md)\r\n- [Hypermedia Response Format](response-format.md)\r\n- [Type Formatting](type-formatting.md)\r\n- [Message Schema and Postels Law](message-schema.md)\r\n- [Security and Authentication](security-and-authentication.md)\r\n- [Search](search.md)\r\n- [Documentation](documentation.md)\r\n- [Error handling](error-handling.md)\r\n- [HTTP Status Codes](http-status-codes.md)\r\n- [Caching](caching.md)\r\n- [FAQ](fq.md)\r\n- [Further Resources](further-resources.md)\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nFor the creation of the style guide I took a lot of input from other authors and even copied whole passages.\r\n\r\nI want to gratefully thank these authors and hope that I marked the relevant passages.\r\nMy resources are listed under [Further Resources](further-resources.md).
